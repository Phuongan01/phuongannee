                            Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former
                            humans
                            who were turned into demons by Muzan injecting them with his own blood and they feed on
                            humans
                            and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain
                            called
                            "Blood Demon Art" and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with
                            weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from
                            Wisteria
                            flowersor exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human;
                            however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as "Breathing Styles", which grant
                            them
                            superhuman strength and increased resistance.</h5>

                                    around the lower section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left of his
                                    forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to watch his father perform the
                                    Hinokami Kagura dance. The scar originally looked somewhat like a graze until his
                                    fight with the Hand Demon during the Final Selection, after which it develops into a
                                    flame-like pattern as his Demon Slayer Mark. It is noted that his hands are visibly
                                    rougher for someone his age, as a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji
